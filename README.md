# Crypto Price Tracker

This is a simple live price tracker that takes in an input, which is the full name of the coin you want to track (based on CoinCap API), and outputs a live refreshing price with VWAP and stores the coin in localStorage to track prices every time you revisit the app. 

## Description

I'm using this as a simple, low-overhead way of tracking crypto prices rapidly and viewing prices over time.
